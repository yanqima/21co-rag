Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and learn from it.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning - Training with labeled data
   - Classification: Categorizing data into classes
   - Regression: Predicting continuous values

2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
   - Clustering: Grouping similar data points
   - Dimensionality Reduction: Simplifying complex data

3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error
   - Agent learns by interacting with environment
   - Rewards and penalties guide behavior

Popular Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Means Clustering

Machine learning powers many modern applications from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles.
